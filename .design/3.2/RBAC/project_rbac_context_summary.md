   - Changes in Edit/Assign pages are saved to shared data
   - Permissions tab reads from shared data and re-renders when navigating back
   - Edit page re-initializes roles when navigating to it to show latest data

### Technical Implementation Details

**Shared Data Pattern:**
- Created `sharedPermissionsData.ts` as centralized data store
- Uses module-level `let` variables for `mockUsers` and `mockGroups`
- Provides update functions: `updateUserRoles()` and `updateGroupRoles()`
- All pages import and use the shared data

**State Management:**
- `ProjectDetail`: Uses React state to store shared data, updates on navigation
  - `rolesVariant`: State for design option ('option1' | 'option2' | 'option3')
  - `openPopovers`: Set of open popover IDs for label popovers
  - `togglePopover`: Function to toggle popover visibility
- `EditRolesPage`: Reads directly from shared data, re-initializes on mount/navigation
- `RoleAssignmentPage`: Updates shared data on save

**Table Structure:**
- Name column uses `rowspan` to span multiple role rows
- Role column: one row per role
- Date created: one per role row
- Actions (kebab): one per role row
- Subsequent role rows have `paddingInlineStart` for alignment

**Edit Roles Page Table:**
- 4 columns: Expand/Checkbox, Role name, Description, Status
- Uses PatternFly `treeRow` prop for expandable functionality
- Expand arrow and checkbox in same cell (first column)
- Expandable rows show rules in nested table format
- CSS transform rotates arrow icon 90° when expanded

**Assign Roles Page:**
- **Comparison Modal**:
  - Opens when clicking "Assign roles" button
  - Uses Card components with `selectableActions` prop for checkbox functionality
  - Cards display pros/cons lists with 8px gap between sections
  - Radio buttons in card headers (shared name="assign-option")
  - Buttons aligned to left with 24px gap from modal body
  - Light purple background (#f0e6ff)
- **Option 2 Subject Selection Modal**:
  - Form with Subject kind radio buttons and User/Group name TypeaheadSelect
  - 24px gap between intro text and form fields
  - Buttons aligned to left with 24px gap from modal body
  - Navigates with URL parameters: `?option=2&subjectType=...&subjectName=...`
- **Subject Section**:
  - TypeaheadSelect from `@patternfly/react-templates` with `isCreatable={true}`
  - `createOptionMessage` prop customizes create option text
  - Helper text and inline alert for user guidance
  - Warning alert in Option 1 when subject selected
  - User name field is required (`isRequired` prop)
  - Option 2: Subject kind hidden, read-only display with icon
  - User/Group icons: 16px × 16px, circular background, 4px gap from name
  - Icons use SVG paths with CSS variables for colors
- **Role Assignment Table**:
  - Reuses Option 2 sorting logic from EditRolesPage
  - Role names are clickable buttons that open modal
  - Both Role name and Status columns are sortable
  - Filters OpenShift custom roles for new subjects
  - Tracks `originallyAssigned` to show "Currently assigned" status
- **Role Rules Modal**:
  - Uses Modal component with sortable rules table
  - Pagination with "View more" button
  - Shows role name with badge in header

**Label Rendering (Permissions Tab):**
- `renderAILabel()`: Renders AI label with sparkle icon, wrapped in Popover for Option 2
  - AI label uses PatternFly `color="green"` prop for green background
  - Label is filled variant, clickable with popover
- `renderRoleBadge()`: Renders role name and labels based on variant
  - Option 1: Filled labels (OpenShift default/custom) with popovers, no AI labels
  - Option 2: All labels (filled variant) with popovers, including AI labels
  - Option 3: No labels
- `getLabelPopoverContent()`: Returns title and body for popover content
- Labels use onClick handlers to manually open popovers
- Popover state managed via `openPopovers` Set and `setOpenPopovers` function
- Popover uses `shouldOpen`/`shouldClose` callbacks to manage visibility
- Role column header popover uses PatternFly `Th` component's `info` prop for question mark icon placement

8. **Manage roles – Concept for testing (option5) – Role assignment table and behavior:**
   - **Design Option:** Dropdown shows "Original design" and "Concept for testing" (Archived option hidden).
   - **Expandable Role assignment table:** Width 960px, expand column, columns: Checkbox, Role name, Description, Role type, Assignment status. Expandable row contains "Resource scoping" label (wrapper paddingLeft 4.5rem, label marginLeft 16px) and inner table.

   - Info alert added above Save/Cancel in both Assign roles and Manage roles.
   - Text: "Make sure to inform the specified user about the updated role assignments."
   - PatternFly Alert, variant info, isInline.

10. **CreateRole (Settings – User Management):**
    - Permission rules dropdown: First option "Add custom rule", second "Add rule from template."
    - Rule template modal: All role template descriptions use syntax "A set of rules that grants users to ..." (Admin, Contributor, Deployment/Pipeline/Workbench maintainer/reader/updater).

    - When URL has `?option=2`, assignRolesVariant defaults to 'option2' so Concept for testing table is shown by default.
    - Admin and Contributor show plain text "All resources" in the expandable list.
    - Option 2 table wrapper has `key="option2-role-table"` so the table remounts correctly when switching options.

    - **Manage roles:** Concept for testing is the default when users open the page. Only `?designOption=option3` shows Original design.

13. **Workbench maintainer – Expandable list rules (Concept for testing):**
    - First row: Actions create/delete/deletecollection/get/list/patch/update/watch, API groups api.workbench.group, Resource Workbench, Resource names = Workbench selection dropdown ("All workbenches" etc.).
    - Following rows from reference: namespaces (resource names = current project name in plain text), notebooks, imagestreams, persistentvolumeclaims, persistentvolumeclaims/status, pods/statefulsets, secrets/configmaps, hardwareprofiles, events. Resources column shows each rule's actual resources (rule.resources.join), not role-based "Workbenches".
    - **Display rules:** When verbs include '*', Actions column shows "create, delete, deletecollection, get, list, patch, update, watch". When API groups are empty ('' or []), API groups column shows '*'. For rule with resources including 'namespaces', Resource names column shows projectId (current project name).

14. **Workbench updater – Expandable list rules (Concept for testing):**
    - Kept existing first row (Workbenches, api.groups.name, get/list/patch/update/watch). Added 9 rows: namespaces (resource names = projectId), notebooks (get, watch, list, update, patch), imagestreams, persistentvolumeclaims, persistentvolumeclaims/status, pods/statefulsets, secrets/configmaps, hardwareprofiles, events. Same display rules as Workbench maintainer for '*' and empty API groups.

15. **Resource names column header – Popover:**
    - Question mark after "Resource names" in the expandable rules table (and in role details modal rules table) opens a popover. Content: "Specify the resource instances. The empty resource names mean that you don't need to configure." Click icon to toggle; showClose; uses existing openPopovers state (ids: resource-names-header-popover, resource-names-modal-popover). Applied in both Manage roles and Assign roles pages.

16. **Manage roles page – Description (all design options):**
    - Replaced "Description goes here." under the "Manage roles" heading with: "Edit the role assignments of the user " + subject name (from URL subjectName) + "." Subject name is rendered in semibold (fontWeight: 600), no quotes. Applies to both Original design and Concept for testing.

   - Added `popperProps={{ position: 'end' }}` to both Users and Groups kebab `Dropdown` components in `ProjectDetail.tsx`

   - Assign roles page (`RoleAssignmentPage.tsx`): "Assign roles" → "Manage permissions"
   - Manage roles page (`EditRolesPage.tsx`): "Manage roles" → "Manage permissions"
   - All other text/labels that still say "Assign roles" or "Manage roles" (comparison bars, option labels, code comments, etc.) are unchanged

2. **Typeahead Dropdown – 'Users with existing assignment' Group Header:**
   - Replaced `TypeaheadSelect` from `@patternfly/react-templates` with a fully custom implementation using lower-level PatternFly components (`Select`, `MenuToggle`, `TextInputGroup`, `TextInputGroupMain`, `TextInputGroupUtilities`)
   - When the user types something that matches existing subjects, a non-selectable group header "Users with existing assignment" (or "Groups with existing assignment") appears above those matches
   - The "Assign role to '[input]'" option always appears at the top, above the group header
   - Group header is hidden when there are no matching existing subjects
   - Removed `typeaheadKey` state (no longer needed with custom implementation)

3. **Role Type Column Header – Popover Content Updated:**
   - Updated popover body in the 'Role type' column header of the role assignment table
   - New content is a bullet list explaining AI roles, OpenShift default roles, and OpenShift custom roles
   - Applied in both `RoleAssignmentPage.tsx` and `EditRolesPage.tsx`

4. **Assignment Status Column Header – Popover Content Updated:**
   - Updated popover body in the 'Assignment status' column header
   - New bullet list: Assigned (role is applied), Assigning (will be applied on save), Unassigning (will be revoked on save)
   - Applied in both pages

5. **'Currently assigned' → 'Assigned' in Table Cells:**
   - Renamed status label from "Currently assigned" to "Assigned" throughout the role assignment table (cell rendering, `getAssignmentStatus`, `getStatusPriority`, `renderAssignmentStatus` / `renderStatusBadge`)
   - Applied in both `RoleAssignmentPage.tsx` and `EditRolesPage.tsx`

6. **Workbench Maintainer & Updater – 6 New Resource Name Dropdowns:**
   - Added resource name dropdowns for all non-namespace, non-Workbench rules in both roles:
     - notebooks → workbench dropdown (reuses MOCK_WORKBENCHES)
     - imagestreams → MOCK_IMAGESTREAMS dropdown
     - persistentvolumeclaims → MOCK_PVCS dropdown
     - pods / statefulsets → MOCK_PODS dropdown
     - secrets / configmaps → MOCK_ENV_VARS dropdown
     - hardwareprofiles → MOCK_HARDWARE_PROFILES dropdown
   - Each dropdown uses a unique `dropdownId = '${role.id}-${ruleIndex}'`
   - Mock data (`MOCK_IMAGESTREAMS`, `MOCK_PVCS`, `MOCK_PODS`, `MOCK_ENV_VARS`, `MOCK_HARDWARE_PROFILES`) includes `description` field for each item (consistent with MOCK_WORKBENCHES)
   - New state variables and helper functions added for each resource type (e.g. `roleImagestreamSelection`, `getImagestreamSelectionForRole`)
   - Applied in both pages

7. **Workbench Maintainer & Updater – First Rule Row Removed:**
   - Removed the first rule (resources: ['Workbench'] / ['Workbenches']) from the mock data for both Workbench maintainer and Workbench updater in both pages

   - 'Select PVCs' → 'Select a PVC'
   - 'Select pods' → 'Select a pod'
   - 'Select environment variables' → 'Select an environment variable'
   - 'Select hardware profiles' → 'Select a hardware profile'
   - Applied in both pages

9. **Resource Dropdown – Multiple Dropdown Fix (MenuContainer ref stability):**
   - **Root cause**: `renderResourceDropdown` created a new getter/setter proxy object (`menuRefObj`) on every render; PatternFly's `MenuContainer` held a stale reference, so menus for new dropdowns never opened
   - **Fix**: Replaced unstable getter/setter proxy with a stable `{ current: null }` object cached in `resourceMenuRefMap` per `did`. Each dropdown now reuses the same object across renders
   - Also fixed a one-line bug in `RoleAssignmentPage.tsx` where `TextInputGroupMain`'s `onClick` used `role.id` instead of `did`, causing non-first-rule dropdowns to target the wrong state slot
   - Applied in both `RoleAssignmentPage.tsx` and `EditRolesPage.tsx`

---

      - Bold category names ("Assigning roles", "Unassigning roles", "AI roles", "OpenShift custom roles")
      - Count badges showing number of roles in each category
      - TreeView with `hasGuides` prop showing connecting lines
      - All nodes expanded by default (`defaultExpanded: true`)
    - **Conditional Alert**:
      - Shows danger alert ONLY if OpenShift custom roles are being unassigned
      - Alert text: "The OpenShift custom roles were assigned from OpenShift. You need to contact your admin to reassign them outside the OpenShift AI once you unassign them."
      - Hidden if only regular/AI roles are being changed
    - **Modal Actions**:
      - "Confirm" button (primary, not danger) - executes save
      - "Cancel" button (link) - closes modal without saving
      - Removed type-to-confirm requirement
      - Changed from "Remove" button to "Confirm" button
    - **Applied in**: Both Assign roles page and Manage roles page
    - **Imported Components**: Added `TreeView` and `TreeViewDataItem` from `@patternfly/react-core`

33. **Collapse/Expand All Functionality in Confirmation Modal:**
    - Added state: `allTreeItemsExpanded` (initially `true`)
    - Button text toggles: "Collapse all" ↔ "Expand all"
    - Click button: `setAllTreeItemsExpanded(!allTreeItemsExpanded)`
    - TreeView prop: `allExpanded={allTreeItemsExpanded}`
    - Behavior:
      - Initial: All expanded, shows "Collapse all"
      - Click "Collapse all": All nodes collapse, button becomes "Expand all"
      - Click "Expand all": All nodes expand, button becomes "Collapse all"
      - Modal close: Resets to `true` (expanded) for next open
    - Applied in both Assign roles page and Manage roles page modals

34. **Role Type Labels - Removed Popover Functionality:**
    - Removed all popover functionality from role type labels across all pages
    - Labels are now non-clickable (removed `cursor: pointer`, `onClick` handlers, and `Popover` wrappers)
    - Applied to "AI role", "OpenShift default role", and "OpenShift custom role" labels
    - Affected pages:
      - Assign roles page (Role assignment table)
      - Manage roles page (Role assignment table)
      - Role details modal (header labels)
    - Labels maintain their visual appearance (outlined gray) but are now static/informational only

35. **Changes Confirmation Modal - New Expandable Group Pattern:**
    - **Replaced TreeView with Custom Expandable Groups**:
      - Removed PatternFly TreeView component
      - Implemented custom expandable/collapsible groups using link buttons
      - Two main groups: "Assigning roles" and "Unassigning roles"
    - **Group Headers**:
      - Use link button variant with expand/collapse icons (AngleDownIcon/AngleRightIcon)
      - Display count badge after group name (e.g., "Assigning roles 2")
      - Groups expanded by default (`expandedGroups` state initialized with both groups)
      - Clicking header toggles expansion state
    - **Role Items Display**:
      - Roles displayed in unordered list (`<ul>`) with no list style
      - Each role shows: role name + role type labels
      - Role type labels rendered inline with role name (AI role, OpenShift default role, OpenShift custom role)
      - 8px gap between role name and labels
      - 24px left margin for list items (indentation)
    - **OpenShift Custom Roles Alert**:
      - Alert moved to appear under "Unassigning roles" group
      - Alert remains visible even when "Unassigning roles" group is collapsed
      - Alert text: "The OpenShift custom roles were assigned from OpenShift. You need to contact your admin to reassign them outside the OpenShift AI once you unassign them."
      - Only shows when there are OpenShift custom roles being unassigned
      - Left-aligned with Confirm button (no left margin)
    - **State Management**:
      - Added `expandedGroups` state: `Set<string>` tracking which groups are expanded
      - Initial state: `new Set(['assigning-roles', 'unassigning-roles'])` (both expanded)
      - State resets when modal closes
    - **Removed Features**:
      - Removed "Collapse all" / "Expand all" button (replaced by individual group toggles)
      - Removed TreeView component and related imports
      - Removed `allTreeItemsExpanded` state (no longer needed)
    - Applied in both Assign roles page and Manage roles page

36. **Changes Confirmation Modal - Type-to-Confirm for All Role Removal:**
    - **Detection Logic**:
      - Detects when all currently assigned roles are being unassigned
      - Condition: `originallyAssignedRoles.length > 0 && currentlyAssignedRoles.length === 0`
      - Shows type-to-confirm section only in this scenario
    - **Type-to-Confirm Section**:
      - Single paragraph combining both messages:
        - "[Subject Name] will lose all permissions and be removed from the current project. Type [Subject Name] to confirm deletion:"
      - Subject name appears semibold (`fontWeight: 600`) in both occurrences
      - TextInput field below the paragraph for confirmation
      - FormGroup without label (label text is in paragraph above)
    - **Confirm Button Behavior**:
      - Disabled when type-to-confirm is required and input doesn't match subject name
      - Only enabled when: `confirmInputValue === subjectName`
      - Prevents accidental removal of all roles
    - **State Management**:
      - Added `confirmInputValue` state for the input field
      - State cleared when modal closes or cancels
    - Applied in both Assign roles page and Manage roles page

37. **Changes Confirmation Modal - Red Exclamation Icon for Unassigned OpenShift Custom Roles:**
    - **Visual Indicator**:
      - Red exclamation icon appears after "OpenShift custom role" label in the role list
      - Only shown when OpenShift custom role is being unassigned
      - Icon: `ExclamationCircleIcon` from PatternFly icons
      - Color: Red using PatternFly danger color variable (`var(--pf-t--global--text--color--status--danger--default)`)
      - Size: 16px font size
    - **Tooltip on Hover**:
      - Tooltip appears when hovering over the exclamation icon
      - Tooltip content: "Role can only be re-assigned in OpenShift"
      - Uses PatternFly `Tooltip` component
      - Icon wrapped in Tooltip component
    - **Implementation**:
      - Added to `renderRoleTypeLabelForModal` function
      - Checks if role is being unassigned: `role.originallyAssigned && !role.currentlyAssigned`
      - For OpenShift custom roles being unassigned, returns Flex container with label + icon
      - For other cases, returns just the label
    - **Imports Added**:
      - `ExclamationCircleIcon` from `@patternfly/react-icons`
    - Applied in both Assign roles page and Manage roles page confirmation modals

38. **List View - Button and Menu Text Updates:**
    - Changed "Assign roles" button to "Manage permissions" in the list view (ProjectDetail.tsx)
    - Changed "Manage roles" kebab menu action to "Manage permissions" in both Users and Groups sections
    - Applied in ProjectDetail.tsx toolbar and kebab menus
    - Improves consistency with the "Manage permissions" terminology used throughout the application

39. **Role Assignment Page - Assignees Tab Added:**
    - Added "Assignees" tab to role details modal in Role assignment table
    - Modal now has two tabs: "Role details" and "Assignees"
    - Assignees tab shows table with columns: Subject, Subject kind, Role binding, Date created
    - All columns are sortable
    - Date created column has question mark icon with popover explaining "Date when the role assignment was created."
    - Uses `getRoleAssignees()` function to fetch assignees for each role
    - Includes sorting functionality with `getAssigneesSortParams()` and `getSortedAssignees()` functions
    - Tab state managed with `roleModalTabKey` (defaults to 0 - Role details tab)
    - Applied in RoleAssignmentPage.tsx
    - Matches the implementation in ProjectDetail.tsx role details modal

40. **Settings - User Management Expandable Section:**
    - Made "User management" expandable in Settings navigation (similar to "Cluster settings")
    - Now includes two sub-items:
      - "User management" → `/settings/user-management`
      - "Roles" → `/settings/user-management/roles`
    - Created new Roles component at `src/app/Settings/UserManagement/Roles.tsx`
    - Updated routes.tsx to convert User management from single route to expandable group
    - Navigation structure matches Cluster settings pattern

41. **Settings - Roles Tab - Role List Table:**
    - Added comprehensive role list table in Roles tab (Settings -> User management -> Roles)
    - **Toolbar Features**:
      - Category filter dropdown (All categories, Project Management, Deployment Management, etc.)
      - Search input for filtering roles by name or description
      - Type filter buttons (All, Default, Custom)
      - "Create role" button (primary)
      - "Delete role" button (secondary, disabled)
      - Pagination controls
    - **Table Columns**:
      - Role: Role name (clickable link) with OpenShift name below in smaller gray text
      - Description: Role description text
      - Category: Role category (e.g., "Project Management", "Deployment Management")
      - Type: Badge showing "Default" or "Custom"
      - Actions: Kebab menu with Edit and Delete options
    - **Features**:
      - All columns are sortable (Role, Description, Category, Type)
      - Filtering by category, type, and search text
      - Pagination (10 items per page by default)
      - Mock data with 10 roles matching common role patterns
    - **Removed Features**:
      - Checkbox column removed (no selection mechanism)
      - Select all checkbox removed from toolbar
      - Delete role button always disabled (no selection state)
    - Applied in Roles.tsx component

42. **Settings - Create Role Form (CreateRole.tsx) - Current State and Key Decisions:**
    - **Single Browse Drawer (Resources + API Groups):**
      - One drawer is used for both "Browse and select resources" and "Browse and select API groups."
      - State: `isResourcesDrawerOpen` (drawer open/close), `browseDrawerMode: 'resources' | 'apiGroups'` (which content to show).
      - "Browse and select resources" sets `browseDrawerMode('resources')` and opens the drawer; "Browse and select API groups" sets `browseDrawerMode('apiGroups')` and opens the same drawer.
      - Panel content is conditional on `browseDrawerMode`: either Resources or API Groups `BrowseDrawerPanelContent` with respective props.
    - **Shared BrowseDrawerPanelContent Component:**
      - Single component used for both Resources and API Groups panels (same structure and behavior).
      - Structure: DrawerPanelContent > DrawerHead (title + close) > DrawerPanelBody (scrollable).
      - DrawerPanelBody: no top padding (`paddingTop: 0`); left/right/bottom padding only. Sticky block has `paddingTop` so there is no gap between drawer title and sticky header (avoids list items showing in the gap when scrolling).
      - Sticky block: `position: sticky`, `top: 0`, `zIndex: 10`, solid background (`var(--pf-v5-global--BackgroundColor--100, #ffffff)`). Contains search input, "Filter by category" label, ToggleGroup (All/Core/...), then scrollable category list with rows (name, description, Add button).
      - Prevents overlap: sticky header has opaque background and higher z-index so scrolling list items do not show through or appear above it.
    - **Verbs (Permissions) - Select/Deselect All Categories:**
      - "Select all categories" button: selects all verbs for that rule (all keys in `defaultVerbs` set to `true`). Handler: `handleSelectAllCategories(ruleIndex)`.
      - After all verbs are selected, the button label becomes "Deselect all categories". Clicking it deselects all verbs for that rule. Handler: `handleDeselectAllCategories(ruleIndex)`.
      - Helper: `isAllCategoriesSelected(verbs)` returns true when every verb in the rule is selected; used for button label and to decide which handler to call.
      - Per-category "Select all" / "Deselect all" in each operations card (Read, Write, Delete, Advanced) unchanged; they show "Deselect all" when all verbs in that category are selected.
    - **Labels Section (Role Configuration card):**
      - State: `labels` as `Array<{ key: string; value: string }>`.
      - "Add label" link button appends a new key/value row. Each row: Key TextInput (placeholder e.g. "Key (e.g., team, environment)"), Value TextInput (placeholder e.g. "Value (e.g., platform, production)"), and a plain button with `MinusCircleIcon` for remove (aria-label "Remove label").
      - Rows rendered in a Split layout (two filled items for inputs, one for remove button).
    - **Role Configuration card – header and spacing:**
      - "Clear all" is a link button without underline: `variant="link"`, `isInline`, `style={{ paddingLeft: 0, textDecoration: 'none' }}`.
      - 16px gap between the "Role Configuration" title and the first field label ("Role Name"): Form uses `style={{ marginTop: '16px' }}`.
    - **Operations cards (Verbs) – spacing:**
      - 8px gap between the description (under each operation title) and the checkbox section: each card’s checkbox `Grid` has `style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}` (Read, Write, Delete, Advanced Operations).
    - **Permission Rules – scroll to new rule and "no rule defined yet":**
      - **Scroll to new rule:** After "Add rule from scratch", the new rule is expanded (id added to `expandedRuleIds`) and the page scrolls to it after 150ms via `newRuleIdRef` and a `useEffect` that runs when `rules.length` changes; the target element is found by `data-rule-id`. After "Add rule via template", the first newly added rule's id is set in `newRuleIdRef`, so the same effect scrolls to the first new rule when the modal closes.
      - **No rule defined yet:** When adding rules via rule template, if `rules.length <= 1` (no rules or only the default), the template rules **replace** the current list instead of appending, so the first template rule displays as "Rule 1", the next as "Rule 2", etc. When there are already 2+ rules, template rules are appended as before.
    - **Other Create Role Form Details:**
      - Rule templates (Maintainer, Reader, Updater), Add rule dropdown, rule template modal (search + table), Live YAML, permission rules with API groups/Resources/Verbs, `editingRuleIndex` for which rule is being edited when using the browse drawer.
