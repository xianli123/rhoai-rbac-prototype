   - Changes in Edit/Assign pages are saved to shared data
   - Permissions tab reads from shared data and re-renders when navigating back
   - Edit page re-initializes roles when navigating to it to show latest data

### Technical Implementation Details

**Shared Data Pattern:**
- Created `sharedPermissionsData.ts` as centralized data store
- Uses module-level `let` variables for `mockUsers` and `mockGroups`
- Provides update functions: `updateUserRoles()` and `updateGroupRoles()`
- All pages import and use the shared data

**State Management:**
- `ProjectDetail`: Uses React state to store shared data, updates on navigation
  - `rolesVariant`: State for design option ('option1' | 'option2' | 'option3')
  - `openPopovers`: Set of open popover IDs for label popovers
  - `togglePopover`: Function to toggle popover visibility
- `EditRolesPage`: Reads directly from shared data, re-initializes on mount/navigation
- `RoleAssignmentPage`: Updates shared data on save

**Table Structure:**
- Name column uses `rowspan` to span multiple role rows
- Role column: one row per role
- Date created: one per role row
- Actions (kebab): one per role row
- Subsequent role rows have `paddingInlineStart` for alignment

**Edit Roles Page Table:**
- 4 columns: Expand/Checkbox, Role name, Description, Status
- Uses PatternFly `treeRow` prop for expandable functionality
- Expand arrow and checkbox in same cell (first column)
- Expandable rows show rules in nested table format
- CSS transform rotates arrow icon 90° when expanded

**Assign Roles Page:**
- **Comparison Modal**:
  - Opens when clicking "Assign roles" button
  - Uses Card components with `selectableActions` prop for checkbox functionality
  - Cards display pros/cons lists with 8px gap between sections
  - Radio buttons in card headers (shared name="assign-option")
  - Buttons aligned to left with 24px gap from modal body
  - Light purple background (#f0e6ff)
- **Option 2 Subject Selection Modal**:
  - Form with Subject kind radio buttons and User/Group name TypeaheadSelect
  - 24px gap between intro text and form fields
  - Buttons aligned to left with 24px gap from modal body
  - Navigates with URL parameters: `?option=2&subjectType=...&subjectName=...`
- **Subject Section**:
  - TypeaheadSelect from `@patternfly/react-templates` with `isCreatable={true}`
  - `createOptionMessage` prop customizes create option text
  - Helper text and inline alert for user guidance
  - Warning alert in Option 1 when subject selected
  - User name field is required (`isRequired` prop)
  - Option 2: Subject kind hidden, read-only display with icon
  - User/Group icons: 16px × 16px, circular background, 4px gap from name
  - Icons use SVG paths with CSS variables for colors
- **Role Assignment Table**:
  - Reuses Option 2 sorting logic from EditRolesPage
  - Role names are clickable buttons that open modal
  - Both Role name and Status columns are sortable
  - Filters OpenShift custom roles for new subjects
  - Tracks `originallyAssigned` to show "Currently assigned" status
- **Role Rules Modal**:
  - Uses Modal component with sortable rules table
  - Pagination with "View more" button
  - Shows role name with badge in header

**Label Rendering (Permissions Tab):**
- `renderAILabel()`: Renders AI label with sparkle icon, wrapped in Popover for Option 2
  - AI label uses PatternFly `color="green"` prop for green background
  - Label is filled variant, clickable with popover
- `renderRoleBadge()`: Renders role name and labels based on variant
  - Option 1: Filled labels (OpenShift default/custom) with popovers, no AI labels
  - Option 2: All labels (filled variant) with popovers, including AI labels
  - Option 3: No labels
- `getLabelPopoverContent()`: Returns title and body for popover content
- Labels use onClick handlers to manually open popovers
- Popover state managed via `openPopovers` Set and `setOpenPopovers` function
- Popover uses `shouldOpen`/`shouldClose` callbacks to manage visibility
- Role column header popover uses PatternFly `Th` component's `info` prop for question mark icon placement
